        Up in space, turning around, looking at the earth’s face. From that rock’s perspective on Mars or that gaz
        opinion
        from Jupiter, nothing cares about your problems. Up there, it’s just not serious, and there’s no such thing as
        an
        issue.

        Down here, the only reality is the one inside our brain. Nothing exists if the brain doesn’t think it. Nothing
        exists neither if our senses don’t transmit the message. That means that if we mis sense, our reality changes.
        That’s possible because our perception is limited : you can’t see at 360 degrees for example. If we mis
        translate
        the message, our reality changes. If we think it in a way, our reality changes depending on that way. Therefore,
        if
        we can change reality that much, everything’s fake.

        They’re proofs to that. Fall in love with someone and you’ll see that person as divine. Pull yourself out of
        that
        grip and the divine falls from clouds to solid ground, revealing him or herself differently. But the person is
        the
        same, you just changed your mind. Everything works like that : it’s not just that you can make your world, it’s
        that
        you passively do it anyway.

    <blockquote>
        Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around
        to
        commiserate. They said, “We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.” The farmer
        said, “Is it <tag class="good"> good</tag>? Is it <tag class="bad"> bad</tag>? I don't know.” The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with
        it,
        and in the evening everybody came back and said, “Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now
        have
        eight horses!” The farmer again said, “Is it <tag class="good"> good</tag>? Is it <tag class="bad"> bad</tag>? I don't know.” <br>

        The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his
        leg.
        The neighbors then said, “Oh dear, that’s too <tag class="bad"> bad</tag>,” and the farmer responded, “Is it <tag class="good"> good</tag>? Is it <tag class="bad"> bad</tag>? I don't
        know.”
        The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son
        because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, “Isn’t that great!” Again, he said,
        “Is it <tag class="good"> good</tag>? Is it <tag class="bad"> bad</tag>? I don't know.” <br>

        The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell
        whether anything that happens in it is <tag class="good"> good</tag> or <tag class="bad"> bad</tag> — because you never know what will be the consequence of the
        misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of <tag class="good"> good</tag> fortune.

        Conclusion
        <tag class="goog"> Good</tag> and <tag class="bad"> Bad</tag> are just one perspective. Bananas are <tag class="goog"> good</tag> for monkeys, but monkeys are not <tag class="goog"> good</tag> for bananas.
        Let's not
        make a big deal out of it...
