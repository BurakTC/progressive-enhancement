            In nature, <tag class="good"> Good</tag> & Evil do not exist. The Universe itself is neither <tag

                good</tag> nor <tag class="bad"> bad</tag>, but a potential in permanent
            development.

        <p>
            Up in space, turning around, looking at the earth’s face. From that rock’s perspective on Mars or that gaz
            opinion
            from Jupiter, nothing cares about your problems. Up there, it’s just not serious, and there’s no such thing
            as
            an
            issue. <br>

            Down here, the only reality is the one inside our brain. Nothing exists if the brain doesn’t think it.
            Nothing
            exists neither if our senses don’t transmit the message. That means that if we mis sense, our reality
            changes.
            That’s possible because our perception is limited : you can’t see at 360 degrees for example. If we mis
            translate
            the message, our reality changes. If we think it in a way, our reality changes depending on that way.
            Therefore,
            if we can change reality that much, everything’s fake. <br>

            They’re proofs to that. Fall in love with someone and you’ll see that person as divine. Pull yourself out of
            that grip and the divine falls from clouds to solid ground, revealing him or herself differently. <br>
            But the person is
            the same, you just changed your mind. Everything works like that : it’s not just that you can make your
            world,
            it’s that
            you passively do it anyway.

                <q>
                    Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors
                    came
                    around to commiserate. They said, <tag class="villagers">“We are so sorry to hear your horse has run
                        away.
                        This is most unfortunate.” </tag> The
                    farmer said, <tag class="farmer">“Is it <tag class="good"> good</tag>? Is it <tag class="bad"> bad
                        </tag>
                        ? I
                        don't know.”</tag> The next day
                    the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it,
                    and in the evening everybody came back and said,<tag class="villagers">“Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a
                        great
                        turn of events. You now
                        have eight horses!” </tag>The farmer again said, <tag class="farmer"> “Is it <tag class="good">
                            good
                        </tag>? Is it <tag class="bad"> bad </tag>? I
                        don't know.” </tag> <br>

                    The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and
                    broke
                    his
                    leg.
                    The neighbors then said,<tag class="villagers"> “Oh dear, that’s too <tag class="bad"> bad</tag>,”
                    </tag>
                    and the farmer responded, <tag class="farmer">“Is it
                        <tag class="good"> good</tag>? Is it <tag class="bad"> bad</tag>? I don't
                        know.”
                    </tag>
                    The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they
                    rejected
                    his
                    son
                    because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said,<tag class="villagers">
                        “Isn’t
                        that great!” </tag> Again, he
                    said, <tag class="farmer"> “Is it <tag class="good"> good</tag>? Is it <tag class="bad"> bad</tag>?
                        I
                        don't
                        know.” <br> </tag>

                    The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really
                    impossible
                    to
                    tell
                    whether anything that happens in it is <tag class="good"> good</tag> or <tag class="bad"> bad</tag>
                    —
                    because
                    you never know what will be the consequence of the
                    misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of <tag class="good"> good</tag>
                    fortune.

    <p>
        Conclusion
        <tag class="goog"> Good</tag> and <tag class="bad"> Bad</tag> are just one perspective. Bananas are <tag
            class="goog"> good</tag> for monkeys, but monkeys are not <tag class="goog"> good</tag> for bananas.
        Let's not
        make a big deal out of it...
